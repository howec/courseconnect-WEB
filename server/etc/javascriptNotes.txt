/*
you can break js files into modules

if you wanted to move database stuff into own file
var db = require('db.js')

and you'd have imported the content of db into the server.js module

but if you're trying to update a file, you need to incorporate another requires call that can communicate with it
eg. require('SQL')

However, if you are implementing a database, you will need to use another backend that communicates to the database


//parse and firebase
//use firebase for figuring out how to create a database module
//this is another backend that our backend for the website will communicate to
//you can host your code into the firebase as well


Note: if curly braces are not attached to a function then they're an object
